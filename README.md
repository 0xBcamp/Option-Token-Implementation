# Option-Token-Implementation

The goal of this project will be to create a sustainable, easy to manage tokenomics solution which can be applied to all of our portfolio projects.

Create a functional, tested oToken system for Oath and/or Grain which follows Bunniâ€™s oLIT specification. This system should use the Bonded Oath pool for an oracle. Additionally, create a contract that allows users to burn their oTokens and receive 100% of the Oath to create a bOath LP that remains locked in the protocol for 6 months. Work with Munchies and Morgan to implement these solutions on the front end.

Strengths:
- Can help offset selling pressure that normal token rewards would cause
    - By allowing people to use the options, given long enough expiries, they'll be incentivized to hold longer rather than dumping immediately when the rewards are received 
- Allows for additional capital to be kept by protocols
    - Additional capital for protocol allows for continued funding of devs and further life of the project, increasing the liklihood that tokens don't dump and continue to rise
    - Such a positive spiral would skyrocket the demand and utility for Option Tokens
- Wide array of possibilities for implementation
    - Because of the adaptability of the concept and token, it provides a lot of opportunity for protocols to implement it
- Both Lookee and Ben have solid experience in solidity and this project is heavily focused on solidity
- Lookee and Ben are only one hour apart on time zones so syncing up is easy
- Excellent oversight from Eidolon and Bytemasons team
    - Will allow us to overcome many challenges that may have become significant without experience mentorship


Weaknesses:
- Provides somewhat of a sell pressure relief value via incentive to not dump immediately but also does push off sell pressure until later (delays/defers)
- Somewhat a new idea, may provide attack vectors that haven't been found yet (but is the case with all newer token styles)
- Initial acceptance by broader crypto community and users
    - Because it is new/novel, people may not want to use it as readily as more established types of reward systems


Opportunities:
- Building over a novel DeFi concept with guidance from industry experts
- Learning from existing implementations, iterating over their pros and cons to make an optimized product.
- Availability of resources



Threats:
- End user unfamiliarity with the new concept. (option tokens are a novel concept and people may be skeptical or otherwise weary of new types of protocols)
- Deciding the optimal way to do things may be difficult depending on the chosen implementation
- Fine-tuning of parameters. (picking optimal vesting durations, multipliers, etc. may be difficult)
    -It is unlikely users may pick up on this to a heavy degree but the implementation could heavily effect the success of the project
- Massive accumulation of whales if using non-expiry
    -If no expiry is used, it does provide less immediate sell pressure but also can leave to a sword of damacles where whales accumulate large positions over time
