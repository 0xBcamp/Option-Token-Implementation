# Option-Token-Implementation

The goal of this project will be to create a sustainable, easy to manage tokenomics solution which can be applied to all of our portfolio projects.

Create a functional, tested oToken system for Oath and/or Grain which follows Bunniâ€™s oLIT specification. This system should use the Bonded Oath pool for an oracle. Additionally, create a contract that allows users to burn their oTokens and receive 100% of the Oath to create a bOath LP that remains locked in the protocol for 6 months. Work with Munchies and Morgan to implement these solutions on the front end.

Strengths:
-Can help offset selling pressure that normal token rewards would cause
    -By allowing people to use the options, given long enough expiries, they'll be incentivized to hold longer rather than dumping immediately when the rewards are received 
-Allows for additional capital to be kept by protocols
    -Additional capital for protocol allows for continued funding of devs and further life of the project, increasing the liklihood that tokens don't dump and continue to rise
    -Such a positive spiral would skyrocket the demand and utility for Option Tokens

Weaknesses:
-Provides somewhat of a sell pressure relief value via incentive to not dump immediately but also does push off sell pressure until later (delays/defers)
-Somewhat a new idea, may provide attack vectors that haven't been found yet (but is the case with all newer token styles)

Opportunities:
- Building over a novel DeFi concept with guidance from industry experts
- Learning from existing implementations, iterating over their pros and cons to make an optimized product.
- Plentifulness of resources


Threats:
- End user unfamiliarity with the new concept. (option tokens are a novel concept)
- Wide amount of possibilities for implementation. (there are many ways the token could be implemented and deciding the optimal way to do things may be difficult)
- Fine-tuning of parameters. (picking optimal vesting durations, multipliers, etc. may be difficult)
