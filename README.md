# Option-Token-Implementation

The goal of this project will be to create a sustainable, easy to manage tokenomics solution which can be applied to all of our portfolio projects.

Create a functional, tested oToken system for Oath and/or Grain which follows Bunniâ€™s oLIT specification. This system should use the Bonded Oath pool for an oracle. Additionally, create a contract that allows users to burn their oTokens and receive 100% of the Oath to create a bOath LP that remains locked in the protocol for 6 months. Work with Munchies and Morgan to implement these solutions on the front end.
